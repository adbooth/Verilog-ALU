README for Verilog Arithmetic Logic Unit
By: Andrew D Booth

Submission is a 32-bit bit slice ALU.
Has inputs a, b, opcode
Has outputs ZERO, out, OVERFLOW, cout

ZERO output can be used in a processor with BEQ instructions
OVERFLOW asserts a 1 when overflow occurred
cout outputs the carry out of the most significant bit during addition, which can be used for using two ALUs in parallel

Defined modules:
 - muxTwo: single bit 2-to-1 multiplexer
 - muxFour: single bit 4-to-1 multiplexer. Made up of 3 muxTwos
 - fullAdder: single bit adder with inputs a, b, cin (carry in) and outputs sum and cout (carry out)
 - bitSlice: single bit ALU, can perform by itself ANDing, ORing, addition and subtraction. Has set and less inputs/outputs for SLT
 - ALU: 32-bit ALU, has nor gate for ZERO, XOR gates for OVERFLOW and set (for SLT)

Simulation is done using the test bench ALUTester
